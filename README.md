# k-nn
simple k-nearest neighbour classifier.
tested using the [abalone](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Abalone) dataset from the [UCI machine learning repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.html)
Has several evaluation functions including:
- accuracy
- macro precision
- macro recall
- micro precision
- micro recall
- young-precision
- young-recall
- old-precision
- old-recall
- F1-score

I have also implemented several distance metrics:
- manhattan distance
- euclidean distance
- cosine similarity
